* Browser-specific failures are reported clearly.
* Browser configuration does not require changes to the underlying test logic.

**Dependencies:** Playwright, browser projects, automated regression suite, test configuration
**Source:** Test Scope — Cross-Browser & Environment Coverage
**Automation Candidate:** Yes

**Notes:**
Cross-browser execution is part of regression coverage. Critical customer and administration workflows should receive priority when executing against all supported browsers.

### ENV-002 — Configurable Environment Execution

**ID:** ENV-002
**Title:** Configurable Environment Execution
**Domain:** Cross-Browser & Environment Coverage
**Actor:** QA Automation Framework

**Requirement:**
The automation framework shall support execution of the automated test suite against different application environments without requiring changes to the test logic.

**Preconditions:**

* Playwright automation framework is configured.
* Application environments are defined.
* Environment-specific configuration is available.
* Automated test suite is available for execution.

**Trigger:**
The test suite is executed against a selected application environment.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The framework loads the configuration corresponding to the selected environment.
* Tests execute against the correct application environment.
* Environment-specific values are separated from test logic.
* The same automated test scenarios can be reused across supported environments.

**Business Rules:**

* Environment configuration must be managed independently from test logic.
* Changing the target environment must not require modification of individual test cases.
* Environment-specific settings must be configurable through the automation framework.
* Tests must use the correct configuration for the selected environment.

**Priority:** High
**Risk:** Medium

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Tests can be executed against the configured environments.
* The target environment can be selected through configuration.
* The correct application URL/configuration is loaded for each environment.
* Test logic remains unchanged when switching environments.
* Environment-specific configuration is not hardcoded inside individual tests.
* Incorrect or missing environment configuration is handled appropriately.

**Dependencies:** Playwright, environment configuration, test configuration, application environments, CI/CD configuration
**Source:** Test Scope — Cross-Browser & Environment Coverage
**Automation Candidate:** Yes

**Notes:**
This requirement supports maintainability and CI/CD execution by separating environment configuration from test implementation. It allows the same regression suite to be reused across different application environments.
