# 1. Test Objectives

The primary objective of this test strategy is to establish a reliable, maintainable, and scalable automated testing approach for the nopCommerce e-commerce platform using Playwright.

The test automation framework aims to:

1. **Validate critical business workflows**
   Verify that business-critical e-commerce workflows behave as expected across the customer-facing storefront and relevant administrative functionality.

2. **Verify functional correctness**
   Ensure that implemented features meet their defined requirements and acceptance criteria across supported application modules.

3. **Protect critical user journeys against regression**
   Detect functional regressions early by automatically executing a repeatable regression suite against key workflows after application changes.

4. **Validate end-to-end customer workflows**
   Automate complete user journeys such as authentication, product discovery, shopping cart operations, checkout, and order-related workflows where supported by the requirements baseline.

5. **Validate role-based behavior**
   Verify that different application actors, including Guest, Buyer, Vendor, Administrator, and Store Owner, receive the expected access and behavior according to their defined permissions and business rules.

6. **Validate negative and boundary scenarios**
   Verify that the application handles invalid inputs, unexpected user actions, boundary conditions, and other negative scenarios correctly.

7. **Validate integrations and dependent workflows**
   Verify application behavior around external dependencies such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and external authentication providers where these integrations are part of the testable scope.

8. **Provide traceability between requirements and automated tests**
   Maintain a clear relationship between defined requirements, test scenarios, automated test cases, and execution results.

9. **Enable reliable automated test execution**
   Build automated tests that are deterministic, isolated, repeatable, and suitable for execution locally and through CI/CD pipelines.

10. **Provide fast feedback on application quality**
    Enable automated execution to identify failures quickly and provide actionable test results to support development and release decisions.

11. **Support risk-based test prioritization**
    Prioritize automation coverage according to business criticality, user impact, technical risk, and likelihood of regression.

12. **Ensure cross-browser confidence**
    Validate critical workflows across the browser environments defined within the project's supported test matrix.

13. **Provide actionable test reporting**
    Produce clear execution results, failure evidence, logs, screenshots, and traces where applicable to facilitate failure analysis and defect investigation.

14. **Establish a maintainable automation foundation**
    Develop the framework using reusable components, consistent coding standards, clear separation of concerns, and maintainable test architecture.

15. **Support continuous quality validation**
    Integrate automated tests into the development lifecycle so that critical functionality can be continuously validated as changes are introduced.

# 2. Out of Scope

The following areas are excluded from the Playwright functional automation framework.

### 2.1 Real Financial Transactions

* Real credit/debit card transactions
* Real monetary payments
* Production payment processing
* Real customer financial information

Test/sandbox payment mechanisms may be used where available to validate the application's checkout behavior.

### 2.2 External System Internal Behavior

The framework will not test the internal implementation of:

* Payment gateways
* Shipping providers
* External authentication providers
* Third-party marketing platforms
* Other external services

Only the integration behavior exposed by nopCommerce is within scope.

### 2.3 Production Data & Infrastructure

* Production customer data
* Real customer accounts
* Production database validation
* Infrastructure administration
* Server configuration
* Database administration
* Internal backend implementation

### 2.4 Performance & Load Testing

The Playwright framework is not a performance-testing framework.

Therefore, the following are out of scope:

* Load testing
* Stress testing
* Spike testing
* Endurance testing
* Large-scale concurrency testing
* Capacity testing

These activities would be handled using dedicated tools such as k6 or JMeter.

### 2.5 Security & Penetration Testing

The project does not perform:

* Penetration testing
* Vulnerability scanning
* Exploit development
* Security compliance testing
* Infrastructure security testing

Basic security-related functional checks may be automated when they are directly related to an application requirement, such as authentication or authorization behavior.

### 2.6 Accessibility Compliance

Formal accessibility compliance testing, including WCAG conformance assessment, is outside the scope of this Playwright functional automation framework.

### 2.7 Visual & Usability Evaluation

The following are not primary automation objectives:

* Subjective usability assessment
* General UX evaluation
* Minor visual inconsistencies
* Minor spacing/alignment issues
* Cosmetic content differences

Visual regression testing may be introduced later as a separate capability if required.

### 2.8 Third-Party Websites

External websites reached through links or integrations are outside the test boundary.

The test validates that nopCommerce performs the expected navigation or integration behavior, but does not test the external website itself.

### 2.9 Source-Code / Unit-Level Testing

The project focuses on application-level functional automation.

Therefore, it does not cover:

* Unit testing
* Internal class/method testing
* Source-code coverage
* Backend unit tests
* Database-level unit validation

These belong to the development/testing layers outside the Playwright E2E framework.

---

# 3. Scope Boundary

The automation boundary can be summarized as:

**Customer / Admin Action → nopCommerce UI → Expected Application Behavior**

The framework validates the behavior visible through the application's user interface and the business workflows supported by that interface.

External systems are treated as dependencies rather than systems under test.

---

# 4. Automation Scope Principle

Not every possible test case will be automated.

Automation priority will be determined using:

**Business Criticality + Regression Risk + Execution Frequency + Stability + Automation Value**

High-priority scenarios include authentication, product discovery, cart, checkout, order management, customer account management, and critical administration workflows.

Low-value, highly subjective, unstable, or environment-dependent scenarios will remain candidates for manual testing.

# 3. Test Approach

The testing approach for the nopCommerce platform follows a risk-based, layered, and automation-focused strategy. Testing activities will combine manual validation and automated testing across appropriate test levels to provide reliable coverage while minimizing unnecessary end-to-end duplication.

### 3.1 Manual vs Automation

Automation will be prioritized for stable, repeatable, high-value, regression-prone, and frequently executed scenarios.

Manual testing will be used where human judgment provides greater value, including exploratory testing, usability evaluation, subjective validation, unstable scenarios, and scenarios where automation provides limited return on investment.

The automation strategy will focus primarily on critical business workflows, regression-prone functionality, and repeatable validation.

### 3.2 UI vs API

Both UI and API testing will be used as complementary validation layers.

UI/E2E testing will validate critical user-facing workflows and business journeys from the perspective of application users.

API testing will validate backend behavior, business rules, data operations, and API contracts where applicable.

API automation may also be used to prepare test data or support UI scenarios when this provides faster and more reliable test execution.

The same feature may be validated at multiple levels when each level provides distinct testing value.

### 3.3 Risk-Based Approach

Testing and automation priorities will be determined based on business impact, user impact, probability of failure, regression risk, technical complexity, execution frequency, and the potential impact of defects.

High-risk and business-critical functionality such as authentication, product discovery, shopping cart, checkout, payments, order management, and critical administration workflows will receive higher testing and automation priority.

Lower-risk or low-value scenarios may receive reduced automation coverage or remain primarily manual.

### 3.4 Shift-Left

Quality activities will begin as early as possible in the software development lifecycle.

Testing considerations will be introduced during requirement analysis and test planning rather than waiting until the user interface is fully implemented.

QA activities may include reviewing requirements, identifying ambiguities and risks, defining acceptance criteria, designing test scenarios, identifying required test data, and considering API and integration validation before UI automation is implemented.

### 3.5 Test Pyramid

The automation strategy will follow a layered testing approach rather than relying entirely on UI/E2E tests.

Where applicable, the same feature may be validated through different test levels, with each level serving a different purpose.

- **Integration tests** will validate interactions between application components or services.
- **API tests** will provide faster validation of backend behavior, business rules, and data-related operations.
- **UI/E2E tests** will focus on a smaller number of critical end-to-end user journeys.

The number of lower-level and API tests should generally be greater than the number of full UI/E2E tests in order to improve execution speed, reliability, and maintainability.

The exact distribution of tests will be determined based on application architecture, business risk, and testing value rather than applying a fixed numerical ratio.

# 4. Test Levels

The nopCommerce QA Automation Framework will apply multiple test levels to validate the application at different stages, from individual application components to complete end-to-end business workflows.

The test levels define **where testing is performed within the application architecture and workflow**, while specific testing objectives such as functional, regression, smoke, security, and performance testing are defined separately under the Test Types section.

## 4.1 Unit Testing

**Objective:**
Validate individual application components, methods, and business logic in isolation.

**Typical Coverage:**

* Product pricing calculations
* Discount calculations
* Tax calculations
* Cart calculations
* Order status logic
* Validation and business rules

**Automation:**
Unit testing is outside the scope of the Playwright QA Automation Framework because unit tests target individual application components and source-code-level logic rather than the user interface.

---

## 4.2 Integration Testing

**Objective:**
Validate the interactions and data exchange between different application components, services, databases, and external integrations.

**Typical Coverage:**

* Authentication and user management integration
* Cart → Checkout integration
* Checkout → Order creation
* Order → Inventory updates
* Product → Inventory integration
* Payment integration
* Shipping integration
* External authentication
* API interactions
* Application → Database data consistency

**Automation:**
Integration testing may be partially automated through API and integration-level automation where the required interfaces are accessible and suitable for automated validation.

---

## 4.3 System Testing

**Objective:**
Validate the complete nopCommerce application as an integrated system against defined functional requirements and business rules.

**Typical Coverage:**

* Customer registration
* Login / Logout
* Customer profile management
* Product catalog
* Product search and filtering
* Product details
* Shopping cart
* Wishlist
* Checkout
* Order management
* Promotions and pricing
* Customer reviews and subscriptions
* Administration workflows
* Authentication and session management

**Automation:**
System testing is a primary focus of the Playwright QA Automation Framework. Automated tests will validate complete application features through the user interface and, where appropriate, supporting API interactions.

---

## 4.4 End-to-End Testing

**Objective:**
Validate complete business workflows across multiple application modules from the user's entry point through to the expected final business outcome.

**Critical End-to-End Workflows:**

* Guest → Browse Product → Product Details → Add to Cart
* Customer → Login → Search Product → Product Details → Add to Cart → Checkout
* Customer → Checkout → Place Order → Order Confirmation
* Customer → Login → View Order History → View Order Details
* Customer → Update Profile → Manage Address → Verify Changes
* Customer → Logout → Verify Session Invalidation
* Administrator → Login → Manage Product → Save Changes → Verify Storefront Changes
* Administrator → Search Order → Open Order → Verify Order Information → Update Order Status

**Automation:**
Critical end-to-end business workflows will be automated using Playwright. These workflows will receive higher priority because failures can directly affect core customer and administrative business processes.

---

## 4.5 Test Level Strategy Summary

| Test Level              | Primary Purpose                                                                 | Framework Coverage            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Unit Testing**        | Validate individual components and business logic in isolation                  | ❌ Outside Playwright scope    |
| **Integration Testing** | Validate interactions between components, services, databases, and integrations | 🟡 Partial / API-supported    |
| **System Testing**      | Validate the complete application against requirements and business rules       | ✅ Primary Playwright coverage |
| **End-to-End Testing**  | Validate complete business workflows across multiple application modules        | ✅ Playwright                  |

### Framework Focus

The primary focus of the nopCommerce QA Automation Framework is **System Testing and End-to-End Testing using Playwright**, supported by API and integration-level testing where appropriate.

Unit Testing remains outside the scope of this framework because it belongs primarily to the application development layer. Integration Testing is covered selectively through accessible interfaces and supporting API automation, while System and End-to-End Testing provide the main functional validation layer of the Playwright framework.

# 5. Test Types

The nopCommerce QA Automation Framework will apply different test types based on business risk, functional requirements, user impact, regression potential, and automation value.

Each test type defines **what aspect of the system is being validated**, while Test Levels define where the validation is performed.

# 6. Automation Strategy


## 6.1 Automation Objectives

The automation strategy aims to:

Automate high-value and business-critical test scenarios.
Reduce repetitive manual regression effort.
Provide fast and reliable feedback on application quality.
Validate critical user workflows consistently across executions.
Detect regressions early in the development lifecycle.
Improve test repeatability and execution consistency.
Build a scalable and maintainable Playwright automation framework.
Integrate automated testing into CI/CD pipelines.
Provide actionable execution reports and failure evidence.

## 6.2 Automation Scope

Automation will focus primarily on stable, repeatable, and business-critical functionality.

UI Automation

The initial UI automation scope includes:

Registration
Login
Logout
Authentication and session behavior
Product search
Product listing
Product details
Product filtering/sorting
Shopping cart
Checkout
Order placement
Order confirmation
Customer account/profile
Order history
API Automation

Where supported and accessible, API automation will cover:

API availability
Request/response validation
HTTP status codes
Response structure
Required fields
Business rules
Negative scenarios
Schema validation
Data consistency between API and UI where applicable
Out of Automation Scope

The following should not automatically be automated simply because they are technically possible:

One-time exploratory scenarios
Highly unstable functionality
Features with constantly changing UI
Visual/aesthetic validation better handled by dedicated visual testing
CAPTCHA and anti-bot mechanisms
Third-party systems outside the project's control
Scenarios requiring manual human judgment
Scenarios with no meaningful regression value

## 6.3 Automation Prioritization

Automation priority will be based on business risk × execution frequency × stability × automation value.

Priority 1 — Critical

Automate first:

Login
Registration
Product search
Product selection
Cart
Checkout
Order placement
Order confirmation

Priority 2 — High

Customer profile
Order history
Product filtering
Product sorting
Session-related workflows
Important negative scenarios

Priority 3 — Medium

Secondary account functionality
Less frequently used product features
Administrative workflows with stable behavior

Priority 4 — Low

Rarely used functionality
Low-risk scenarios
Highly unstable features
Scenarios with low automation ROI

## 6.4 Automation Approach

The project will use Playwright with JavaScript.

The framework will follow a modular architecture separating:

Test Logic
     ↓
Page / Component Objects
     ↓
Reusable Utilities
     ↓
Configuration / Test Data
     ↓
Application

This separation prevents test cases from becoming tightly coupled to UI implementation details.

## 6.5 Automation Design Principles

The framework will follow these principles:

Maintainability

Tests should be easy to understand, modify, and troubleshoot.

Reusability

Common actions should be implemented once and reused across tests.

Reliability

Tests should avoid unnecessary waits and unstable synchronization.

Independence

Tests should be isolated so that one test does not depend on another test's execution.

Readability

Test names and assertions should clearly describe the expected behavior.

Scalability

The architecture should support increasing test coverage without creating excessive maintenance overhead.

Traceability

Each automated test should be traceable to a requirement or test scenario.

## 6.6 Test Architecture

The automation framework will be organized approximately as:

QA-Automation-playwright-framework/
│
├── tests/
│   ├── ui/
│   ├── api/
│   └── regression/
│
├── pages/
│   ├── LoginPage.js
│   ├── RegisterPage.js
│   ├── ProductPage.js
│   ├── CartPage.js
│   ├── CheckoutPage.js
│   └── AccountPage.js

│
├── playwright.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md

هاد structure غادي نبنيوها بالتدريج، ماشي ضروري تكون كلها موجودة دابا.

## 6.7 Test Suite Strategy

Automation will be divided into execution suites:

Smoke Suite

Small set of critical tests used to determine whether the application is fundamentally functional.

Example:

Launch Application
      ↓
Login
      ↓
Search Product
      ↓
Add Product to Cart
      ↓
Checkout
Regression Suite

Broader automated coverage executed after changes to ensure existing functionality remains stable.

Functional Suite

Tests grouped by individual business functionality.

API Suite

Independent API validation where applicable.

Full Regression

Complete automated regression execution before major releases or when required.

## 6.8 Test Execution Strategy

Tests should support:

Local execution
Headless execution
Headed execution for debugging
Parallel execution
CI execution
Targeted test execution
Tag-based execution
Browser-specific execution

Example:

Smoke
   ↓
Fast feedback

Regression
   ↓
Broader validation

Full Regression
   ↓
Release confidence

## 6.9 Browser Strategy

Initial supported browser coverage:

Chromium
Firefox
WebKit

Priority:

Chromium → Firefox → WebKit

Chromium receives the highest priority because it represents the primary supported execution environment for the project.

## 6.10 Failure Handling

A failed automated test must not immediately be considered an application defect.

The failure should first be classified as:

Test Failure
     ↓
Environment Issue?
     ↓
Test Data Issue?
     ↓
Automation/Framework Issue?
     ↓
Application Defect?

For investigated failures, the framework should capture:

Screenshot
Trace
Video where appropriate
Console information
Network information where useful
Error message
Test name
Environment
Browser
Execution timestamp

## 6.11 Automation Quality Gates

Automation should satisfy minimum quality expectations before being considered production-ready.

Examples:

No known critical framework defects.
Critical smoke tests must pass.
Test data must be isolated and reproducible.
Tests must be independently executable.
Flaky tests must be identified and tracked.
Failed tests must provide sufficient evidence.
Tests must be traceable to requirements/scenarios.
CI execution must be reproducible.

## 6.12 Flaky Test Management

Flaky tests will be explicitly identified rather than hidden.

A flaky test should be:

Detected
   ↓
Investigated
   ↓
Root Cause Identified
   ↓
Fixed
   ↓
Re-executed
   ↓
Returned to Stable Suite

Retries may be used for diagnosis and controlled CI stability, but retries must not be used to hide genuine failures.

## 6.13 Automation Maintenance Strategy

Automation maintenance will include:

Updating selectors after UI changes.
Updating Page Objects.
Updating test data.
Updating API schemas.
Updating browser/dependency versions.
Removing obsolete tests.
Refactoring duplicated code.
Reviewing flaky tests.
Updating requirements/test traceability.

Maintenance is considered part of the automation lifecycle, not an optional activity.

## 6.14 Automation ROI

Automation candidates will be evaluated based on:

Business Criticality
        +
Execution Frequency
        +
Regression Value
        +
Stability
        +
Maintenance Cost
        ↓
Automation Priority

The objective is not maximum automation percentage.

The objective is maximum useful automation coverage with sustainable maintenance cost.

## 6.15 Definition of Automation Success

The automation strategy will be considered successful when the framework can:

Execute critical workflows reliably.
Detect regressions early.
Run consistently locally and in CI.
Produce actionable reports.
Provide failure evidence.
Scale with additional coverage.
Remain maintainable as the application evolves.
Reduce repetitive regression effort.
Maintain clear traceability between requirements and automated tests.
Final Automation Strategy Principle

Automate for confidence, speed, repeatability, and maintainability — not simply for the number of automated test cases.

# 7. Risk-Based Prioritization

The nopCommerce QA Automation Framework will use a **risk-based prioritization approach** to allocate testing effort according to business importance, user impact, likelihood of failure, technical complexity, and change exposure.

The objective is to ensure that the highest-risk functionality receives the deepest and earliest test coverage, while lower-risk functionality is validated using an appropriate level of effort.

Risk-based prioritization will guide:

* Feature testing priority
* Test case priority
* Automation priority
* Regression coverage
* Test execution order
* Browser coverage
* API and UI coverage depth
* Release validation effort

---

## 7.1 Risk Assessment Criteria

Each in-scope feature will be evaluated using the following risk factors.

### Business Impact

Measures the potential business consequence if the functionality fails.

| Score | Description              |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | Minimal business impact  |
| 2     | Low business impact      |
| 3     | Moderate business impact |
| 4     | High business impact     |
| 5     | Critical business impact |

Examples of high business impact functionality:

* Checkout
* Order placement
* Payment-related behavior
* Authentication
* Order management

---

### Likelihood of Failure

Measures how likely the functionality is to fail based on complexity, historical defects, dependencies, and implementation characteristics.

| Score | Description           |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1     | Very unlikely to fail |
| 2     | Unlikely              |
| 3     | Possible              |
| 4     | Likely                |
| 5     | Highly likely         |

Factors considered include:

* Historical defect rate
* Technical complexity
* Number of dependencies
* Data complexity
* Integration points
* Recent implementation changes

---

### Change Exposure

Measures how frequently or significantly the functionality is expected to change.

| Score | Description                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Rarely changed                        |
| 2     | Infrequently changed                  |
| 3     | Occasionally changed                  |
| 4     | Frequently changed                    |
| 5     | Continuously or significantly changed |

Frequently changing functionality requires stronger regression coverage because changes increase the probability of regression.

---

### User Impact

Measures the number and importance of users affected by a potential failure.

| Score | Description                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| 1     | Very limited users                |
| 2     | Small user group                  |
| 3     | Moderate user impact              |
| 4     | Large user impact                 |
| 5     | Broad or customer-critical impact |

---

## 7.2 Risk Identification

Risks will be identified during:

* Requirement analysis
* Test planning
* Feature analysis
* Architecture review
* API analysis
* Exploratory testing
* Defect analysis
* Regression analysis
* Production-like scenario evaluation
* Changes to existing functionality

Potential risks may include:

### Functional Risks

* Incorrect business rules
* Incorrect calculations
* Invalid state transitions
* Missing validation
* Incorrect workflow behavior

### Integration Risks

* Payment integration failure
* Shipping integration failure
* Authentication service failure
* API communication failure
* Data synchronization issues

### Data Risks

* Incorrect customer data
* Incorrect order totals
* Incorrect product pricing
* Data loss
* Inconsistent UI/API data
* Incorrect order status

### Security-Related Risks

* Unauthorized access
* Incorrect role permissions
* Authentication failure
* Session invalidation failure

### Technical Risks

* Complex implementation
* High dependency count
* Unstable external dependencies
* Frequent code changes
* Browser-specific behavior

---

## 7.3 Risk Scoring Model

For this project, risk will be calculated using:

**Risk Score = Business Impact × Likelihood × Change Exposure**

Each factor is scored from **1 to 5**.

The resulting score ranges from:

**1 to 125**

### Risk Classification

| Risk Score | Risk Level | Priority |
| ---------: | ---------- | -------- |
|     76–125 | Critical   | P0       |
|      51–75 | High       | P1       |
|      26–50 | Medium     | P2       |
|       1–25 | Low        | P3       |

The score is used as a prioritization aid rather than an absolute replacement for QA judgment.

A feature with a lower numerical score may still receive higher priority when it affects a critical business or regulatory requirement.

---

## 7.4 Priority Definitions

### P0 — Critical

Failure could significantly affect core business operations, customers, security, or order processing.

P0 functionality requires:

* Highest test coverage
* Early validation
* UI/E2E coverage where applicable
* API validation where applicable
* Negative testing
* Regression coverage
* Cross-browser validation for critical journeys
* Inclusion in smoke coverage where appropriate

Examples:

* Authentication
* Checkout
* Order placement
* Payment-related workflows
* Critical authorization behavior

---

### P1 — High

Failure could materially affect important user workflows or business functionality.

P1 functionality requires:

* Strong functional coverage
* Regression coverage
* Negative testing where applicable
* Appropriate UI/API coverage
* Cross-browser validation for critical scenarios

Examples:

* Product search
* Shopping cart
* Customer account
* Order history
* Product management

---

### P2 — Medium

Failure has a moderate impact and does not immediately prevent the core business workflow from operating.

P2 functionality may receive:

* Functional coverage
* Targeted regression coverage
* Selected automation
* Manual exploratory validation where useful

Examples:

* Wishlist
* Secondary account functionality
* Less frequently used administration features

---

### P3 — Low

Failure has limited impact or the functionality has low business criticality.

P3 functionality may receive:

* Limited automated coverage
* Targeted manual validation
* Exploratory testing where appropriate

Examples:

* Low-risk secondary functionality
* Rarely used features
* Low-value cosmetic behavior

---

## 7.5 Feature Risk Matrix

The following matrix defines the initial risk profile for major nopCommerce functional areas.

| Feature                           | Business Impact | Likelihood | Change Exposure | Risk Score | Priority |
| --------------------------------- | --------------: | ---------: | --------------: | ---------: | -------- |
| Checkout                          |               5 |          4 |               5 |        100 | P0       |
| Order Placement                   |               5 |          4 |               5 |        100 | P0       |
| Authentication                    |               5 |          4 |               4 |         80 | P0       |
| Payment Integration Boundary      |               5 |          4 |               4 |         80 | P0       |
| Shopping Cart                     |               5 |          3 |               5 |         75 | P1       |
| Order Management                  |               5 |          3 |               4 |         60 | P1       |
| Product Search                    |               4 |          4 |               4 |         64 | P1       |
| Customer Account                  |               4 |          3 |               4 |         48 | P2       |
| Product Details                   |               4 |          3 |               3 |         36 | P2       |
| Product Filtering/Sorting         |               3 |          3 |               3 |         27 | P2       |
| Wishlist                          |               3 |          2 |               3 |         18 | P3       |
| Secondary Administration Features |               2 |          2 |               2 |          8 | P3       |

These initial ratings are project assumptions and should be updated when additional requirements, architecture details, or defect history become available.

---

## 7.6 Test Case Prioritization

Risk-based prioritization will also be applied at the individual test-case level.

### P0 Test Cases

Examples:

* Valid customer login
* Invalid authentication behavior
* Protected-area access control
* Add item to cart
* Checkout with valid data
* Order placement
* Order confirmation
* Critical payment workflow behavior

### P1 Test Cases

Examples:

* Search functionality
* Product filtering
* Cart quantity updates
* Customer address management
* Order history
* Important negative scenarios

### P2 Test Cases

Examples:

* Secondary account functionality
* Less frequently used product features
* Non-critical administrative workflows

### P3 Test Cases

Examples:

* Low-impact UI variations
* Rare edge cases with limited business impact
* Low-value scenarios with minimal regression risk

Priority may be increased when a defect has previously been identified in the same area.

---

## 7.7 Risk-Based Test Coverage

Risk level will influence the depth and breadth of testing.

| Priority | Functional | API                          | UI/E2E      | Negative    | Regression | Cross-Browser |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| P0       | High       | High where applicable        | High        | High        | High       | High          |
| P1       | High       | Medium/High where applicable | Medium/High | Medium/High | High       | Medium        |
| P2       | Medium     | Medium where applicable      | Medium      | Medium      | Medium     | Selected      |
| P3       | Low/Medium | As needed                    | Limited     | As needed   | Limited    | Limited       |

The objective is not to apply every test type to every feature.

Coverage depth will be based on:

**Risk + Business Value + Technical Characteristics + Failure Impact**

---

## 7.8 Risk-Based Test Execution Strategy

Risk level will also influence the order in which automated tests are executed.

### Recommended Execution Order

```text
P0 Smoke
    ↓
P0 Critical Functional Tests
    ↓
P0/P1 Regression
    ↓
P0/P1 Cross-Browser Validation
    ↓
P2 Functional / Regression
    ↓
P3 and Extended Coverage
```

This execution order is intended to provide the fastest possible feedback on critical failures.

For CI/CD pipelines, critical tests should execute before broader suites where practical.

---

## 7.9 Risk-Based Automation Prioritization

Risk-based testing and automation prioritization are related but not identical.

A high-risk scenario is a strong candidate for automation when it is also:

* Stable
* Repeatable
* Frequently executed
* Deterministic
* Technically feasible to automate
* Valuable for regression protection

Example:

**Checkout**

```text
High Business Risk
        +
High Regression Risk
        +
Repeatable Workflow
        +
Stable Automation Candidate
        ↓
High Automation Priority
```

A high-risk scenario may still require manual validation when automation cannot provide sufficient value.

---

## 7.10 Defect History and Risk Adjustment

Risk ratings will be adjusted based on observed defects.

Repeated defects in the same functionality may increase:

* Likelihood score
* Regression priority
* Automation priority
* Test coverage depth

For example:

```text
Initial Risk
    ↓
Medium

Repeated defects detected
    ↓
Likelihood increases

Updated Risk
    ↓
High

Action
    ↓
Increase automation and regression coverage
```

---

## 7.11 Risk Review and Reassessment

Risk assessments will be reviewed when significant changes occur.

Reassessment triggers include:

* New features
* Major feature changes
* Architecture changes
* New integrations
* Significant bug fixes
* Repeated failures
* New security concerns
* Increased user impact
* Increased change frequency
* New production-like findings

Risk ratings should not be treated as permanent values.

---

## 7.12 Risk Ownership

Risk decisions should be reviewed collaboratively when working in a team.

Potential contributors include:

* QA
* Developers
* Product/Business stakeholders
* Automation engineers
* Technical leads

For this portfolio project, the QA automation strategy will act as the primary source of documented risk prioritization.

---

## 7.13 Risk-Based Prioritization Summary

The risk-based strategy ensures that testing effort is concentrated where failure would have the greatest impact.

The framework will prioritize:

1. Business-critical functionality
2. High user-impact workflows
3. High-probability failure areas
4. Frequently changing functionality
5. Regression-prone functionality
6. Critical integrations
7. Security-sensitive workflows

The objective is to maximize **risk coverage and defect detection value**, rather than maximizing the number of executed tests.

### Final Principle

**Test the highest-risk functionality first, protect critical business workflows continuously, and allocate automation effort where it provides the greatest quality and regression value.**

# 8. Requirements Traceability

The nopCommerce QA Automation Framework will maintain traceability between defined requirements, test scenarios, test cases, automated tests, test execution results, and defects.

The objective of Requirements Traceability is to ensure that:

* Every in-scope requirement has appropriate test coverage.
* Test scenarios and test cases can be traced back to their originating requirements.
* Automated tests can be linked to the corresponding test cases.
* Test failures can be traced back to affected requirements.
* Defects can be associated with the relevant requirement and test coverage.
* Changes to requirements can be evaluated for their impact on existing tests and automation.
* Test coverage gaps can be identified before release.

---

## 8.1 Traceability Chain

The project will maintain the following traceability relationship:

```text
Requirement
     ↓
Test Scenario
     ↓
Test Case
     ↓
Automated Test
     ↓
Test Execution
     ↓
Defect
```

This relationship provides visibility from the original business requirement through validation and defect resolution.

---

## 8.2 Requirement Identification

Each requirement will be assigned a unique identifier.

Example:

```text
REQ-AUTH-001
REQ-AUTH-002
REQ-CART-001
REQ-CART-002
REQ-CHECKOUT-001
REQ-ORDER-001
```

Requirement identifiers should remain stable even when the requirement description changes.

Requirements may represent:

* Functional behavior
* Business rules
* Validation rules
* Authentication and authorization behavior
* Integration requirements
* Data behavior
* Non-functional requirements where applicable

---

## 8.3 Test Scenario Identification

Each test scenario will reference the requirement that it validates.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
REQ-CART-001

Test Scenario:
TS-CART-001

Description:
Verify that an authenticated customer can add an available product to the shopping cart.
```

A single requirement may have multiple test scenarios covering different conditions.

Example:

```text
REQ-CART-001
    ├── TS-CART-001 Positive scenario
    ├── TS-CART-002 Negative scenario
    ├── TS-CART-003 Boundary scenario
    └── TS-CART-004 Regression scenario
```

---

## 8.4 Test Case Traceability

Each test case will contain a reference to the corresponding requirement and test scenario.

Example:

| Requirement ID | Scenario ID | Test Case ID | Description                   |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| REQ-CART-001   | TS-CART-001 | TC-CART-001  | Add available product to cart |
| REQ-CART-001   | TS-CART-002 | TC-CART-002  | Prevent invalid quantity      |
| REQ-CART-002   | TS-CART-003 | TC-CART-003  | Update cart quantity          |
| REQ-CART-003   | TS-CART-004 | TC-CART-004  | Remove product from cart      |

This allows each test case to be traced directly to a business or functional requirement.

---

## 8.5 Automation Traceability

Automated tests will maintain a clear relationship with the corresponding test case and requirement.

Example:

```text
REQ-CART-001
      ↓
TC-CART-001
      ↓
tests/ui/cart/add-product.spec.js
```

Where practical, requirement and test-case identifiers may be referenced in:

* Test titles
* Test annotations
* Test metadata
* Test management systems
* Documentation
* Source-code comments where appropriate

The objective is to avoid having automated tests with no identifiable business purpose.

---

## 8.6 Test Execution Traceability

Each test execution should provide enough information to identify:

* Requirement
* Test scenario
* Test case
* Automated test
* Execution status
* Browser
* Environment
* Execution timestamp
* Failure evidence where applicable

Example:

```text
REQ-CART-001
      ↓
TC-CART-001
      ↓
Add Product Test
      ↓
FAIL
      ↓
Chromium / CI
      ↓
Trace + Screenshot
```

---

## 8.7 Defect Traceability

Defects identified during testing will be linked to the affected requirement and test coverage.

Example:

```text
REQ-CHECKOUT-001
      ↓
TC-CHECKOUT-005
      ↓
Automated Test
      ↓
FAIL
      ↓
BUG-CHECKOUT-003
```

Defect records should contain references to the relevant:

* Requirement
* Test case
* Test execution
* Evidence
* Environment
* Browser
* Build or commit where applicable

This provides a complete audit trail from requirement to defect.

---

## 8.8 Traceability Matrix

A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) will be used to provide an overview of requirement coverage.

Example:

| Requirement ID | Requirement           | Test Scenario | Test Case   | Automation | Execution | Defect      |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- |
| REQ-AUTH-001   | Customer registration | TS-AUTH-001   | TC-AUTH-001 | ✅          | ✅ Passed  | —           |
| REQ-AUTH-002   | Customer login        | TS-AUTH-002   | TC-AUTH-002 | ✅          | ✅ Passed  | —           |
| REQ-CART-001   | Add product to cart   | TS-CART-001   | TC-CART-001 | ✅          | ✅ Passed  | —           |
| REQ-CART-002   | Update cart quantity  | TS-CART-002   | TC-CART-002 | ✅          | ✅ Passed  | —           |
| REQ-CHK-001    | Complete checkout     | TS-CHK-001    | TC-CHK-001  | ✅          | ❌ Failed  | BUG-CHK-001 |
| REQ-ORD-001    | View order history    | TS-ORD-001    | TC-ORD-001  | ✅          | ✅ Passed  | —           |

The RTM will be updated when requirements, test cases, automation, or defects change.

---

## 8.9 Bidirectional Traceability

Traceability should work in both directions.

### Forward Traceability

Verify that every requirement has appropriate test coverage.

```text
Requirement
     ↓
Test Scenario
     ↓
Test Case
     ↓
Automation
```

### Backward Traceability

Verify that every test exists for a valid requirement or approved testing objective.

```text
Automated Test
     ↓
Test Case
     ↓
Test Scenario
     ↓
Requirement
```

This helps identify both:

* Untested requirements
* Unnecessary or orphaned tests

---

## 8.10 Coverage Analysis

Requirement coverage will be monitored to identify gaps.

Coverage categories may include:

### Covered

Requirement has one or more valid test cases and appropriate execution coverage.

### Partially Covered

Requirement has some test coverage but important scenarios remain untested.

### Not Covered

Requirement has no corresponding test coverage.

### Blocked

Requirement has defined coverage, but execution is currently blocked by an environment, dependency, or other valid constraint.

Example:

| Requirement  | Status            |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| REQ-AUTH-001 | Covered           |
| REQ-CART-001 | Covered           |
| REQ-CHK-001  | Partially Covered |
| REQ-PAY-001  | Blocked           |

---

## 8.11 Change Impact Analysis

When a requirement changes, the affected test coverage will be identified before implementation is updated.

The analysis will evaluate:

```text
Requirement Change
       ↓
Affected Test Scenarios
       ↓
Affected Test Cases
       ↓
Affected Automated Tests
       ↓
Affected Regression Coverage
```

This helps prevent outdated tests and ensures that automation remains aligned with current product behavior.

---

## 8.12 Traceability Maintenance

Traceability information will be maintained throughout the testing lifecycle.

Maintenance activities include:

* Adding traceability for new requirements.
* Updating test cases when requirements change.
* Updating automated tests when test cases change.
* Linking defects to affected requirements and tests.
* Removing obsolete traceability links.
* Reviewing coverage during regression and release preparation.
* Identifying requirements without adequate coverage.

Traceability will be treated as a continuous QA activity rather than a one-time documentation task.

---

## 8.13 Traceability Quality Rules

The following rules will apply:

1. Every in-scope requirement should have at least one associated test scenario.
2. Critical requirements should have appropriate positive, negative, and regression coverage where applicable.
3. Every automated test should have an identifiable test purpose.
4. Test cases should reference their originating requirements.
5. Defects should reference the affected requirement and test coverage where applicable.
6. Obsolete requirements and tests should not remain active in the traceability matrix.
7. Traceability gaps should be reviewed before major regression or release activities.

---

## 8.14 Requirements Traceability Success Criteria

Requirements Traceability will be considered effective when the team can answer the following questions:

* Which tests validate this requirement?
* Which automated tests cover this requirement?
* Has this requirement been executed successfully?
* Which defects are associated with this requirement?
* What tests are affected if this requirement changes?
* Are any critical requirements missing test coverage?

The objective is to provide clear visibility between **business requirements and quality validation** throughout the testing lifecycle.

---

## Final Principle

**Every important requirement should have visible, maintainable, and traceable test coverage, from the original requirement through test execution and defect resolution.**


# 9. Test Data Strategy

The nopCommerce QA Automation Framework will use a controlled, reliable, reusable, and environment-aware test data strategy to support functional, negative, regression, API, and end-to-end testing.

The objective is to ensure that automated tests have the correct data required for execution without introducing unnecessary dependencies, test-order issues, data conflicts, or non-deterministic behavior.

Test data management will be treated as a core part of the automation architecture rather than as hard-coded values inside individual test cases.

---

## 9.1 Test Data Objectives

The test data strategy aims to:

* Provide reliable data for repeatable test execution.
* Keep test data separated from test logic.
* Support positive, negative, and boundary scenarios.
* Reduce test dependencies on shared application state.
* Minimize test-order dependency.
* Support local and CI/CD execution.
* Allow controlled creation and cleanup of test data.
* Prevent the use of real or sensitive customer information.
* Support different application environments.
* Make test failures easier to reproduce and investigate.
* Enable scalable test execution as automation coverage increases.

---

## 9.2 Test Data Categories

The framework will organize test data according to its intended testing purpose.

### Customer Data

Examples include:

* Valid registered customers
* New customer registration data
* Invalid customer credentials
* Locked or restricted accounts where applicable
* Guest customer data
* Customer profile information
* Address information

### Product Data

Examples include:

* Available products
* Out-of-stock products
* Products with different prices
* Products with variants
* Products with discounts
* Products with different availability states

### Cart Data

Examples include:

* Single-product cart
* Multi-product cart
* Different quantities
* Empty cart
* Invalid quantity values
* Product availability changes

### Checkout Data

Examples include:

* Valid billing information
* Valid shipping information
* Invalid required fields
* Different shipping methods
* Different payment methods
* Boundary-value checkout inputs

### Order Data

Examples include:

* Newly created orders
* Existing orders
* Different order statuses
* Orders with different products
* Orders with different totals

### Negative Test Data

Examples include:

* Invalid email addresses
* Invalid passwords
* Empty required fields
* Unsupported values
* Invalid product quantities
* Invalid addresses
* Unauthorized credentials
* Invalid API payloads

### Boundary Test Data

Examples include:

* Minimum accepted value
* Maximum accepted value
* Minimum/maximum quantity
* Maximum field length
* Empty values
* Null or missing values where applicable

---

## 9.3 Test Data Separation

Test data should be separated from test implementation wherever practical.

Example:

```text
tests/
pages/
fixtures/
test-data/
    customers/
    products/
    checkout/
    negative/
    boundary/
```

The objective is to avoid hard-coding large amounts of test data directly inside test files.

Example:

```text
Test Logic
    ↓
Test Data
    ↓
Test Execution
```

This makes test data easier to update without changing the test logic itself.

---

## 9.4 Static vs Dynamic Test Data

The framework will use both static and dynamically generated test data depending on the scenario.

### Static Test Data

Static data may be used when:

* The value is stable.
* The value is required across multiple tests.
* The value represents a known business condition.
* Reproducibility is more important than uniqueness.

Examples:

* Valid search terms
* Fixed boundary values
* Known product identifiers
* Expected validation messages

### Dynamic Test Data

Dynamic data should be generated when uniqueness or isolation is required.

Examples:

* New customer email addresses
* Unique usernames
* Temporary identifiers
* Unique test orders
* Timestamp-based values

Dynamic data reduces collisions between repeated or parallel test executions.

---

## 9.5 Test Data Ownership

The framework should distinguish between:

### Framework-Owned Data

Data created specifically for automation and controlled by the test framework.

Examples:

* Test customers created for a test
* Test orders
* Test-generated addresses
* Temporary test entities

### Application-Owned Data

Data already provided by the environment.

Examples:

* Existing products
* Preconfigured categories
* Existing administration roles
* Pre-existing catalog configuration

Application-owned data should not be modified unnecessarily because changes may affect unrelated tests.

---

## 9.6 Test Data Creation Strategy

Where technically feasible, tests should create the data they require rather than depending on shared pre-existing state.

Preferred order of data creation:

```text
API / Backend setup
        ↓
Database setup where appropriate
        ↓
UI setup when necessary
        ↓
Use data in test
```

API-based data setup should be preferred over UI setup when it is faster, more reliable, and technically available.

Example:

```text
Create Customer via API
        ↓
Create / prepare required data
        ↓
Launch UI
        ↓
Execute customer workflow
```

This reduces unnecessary UI steps and decreases test execution time.

---

## 9.7 Test Data Isolation

Tests should avoid sharing mutable data whenever possible.

The framework should prefer:

* Independent test accounts
* Unique records
* Isolated test entities
* Test-specific data
* Controlled state initialization

A test should not depend on another test having executed successfully before it.

Bad approach:

```text
Test A creates customer
       ↓
Test B uses customer created by Test A
       ↓
Test C updates same customer
```

Preferred approach:

```text
Test A → Own data
Test B → Own data
Test C → Own data
```

This reduces test-order dependency and parallel execution conflicts.

---

## 9.8 Test Data Reusability

Reusable test data should be provided for common scenarios.

Examples:

* Valid customer
* Valid admin user
* Standard product
* Discounted product
* Valid address
* Valid checkout data

Reusable data should be centralized where doing so does not introduce shared mutable state.

---

## 9.9 Sensitive Data Management

The framework will not use real customer or production-sensitive information.

The following should not be committed to source control:

* Real passwords
* Production credentials
* API secrets
* Private tokens
* Payment information
* Personally identifiable customer data

Environment-specific credentials should be provided through:

* Environment variables
* Local `.env` configuration
* CI/CD secrets
* Secret management mechanisms

Example:

```text
TEST_USERNAME
TEST_PASSWORD
API_TOKEN
```

Sensitive values must not be hard-coded in test files.

---

## 9.10 Test Data Environment Strategy

Test data must be compatible with the target environment.

For example:

```text
Development
    ↓
Environment-specific test data

CI
    ↓
CI-specific credentials and test data

Staging
    ↓
Staging-compatible test data
```

The same test logic should be reusable across environments wherever possible.

Environment-specific values should be externalized through configuration rather than embedded in tests.

---

## 9.11 Test Data Cleanup

Test-generated data should be cleaned up when required and technically feasible.

Cleanup may include:

* Temporary customer accounts
* Test orders
* Temporary addresses
* Test-generated records
* Temporary API resources

Cleanup may occur:

```text
After Test
```

or:

```text
After Test Suite
```

depending on the dependency between tests and the application behavior.

The preferred approach is to leave the environment in a predictable state while avoiding unnecessary cleanup operations that could introduce additional failures.

---

## 9.12 Test Data Reset and Recovery

When an environment becomes inconsistent, the framework should support controlled recovery where possible.

Examples:

* Recreating test accounts
* Reinitializing test state
* Restoring known test data
* Recreating temporary test entities

Test data reset procedures should be documented for CI and local development.

---

## 9.13 Test Data for Parallel Execution

Test data strategy must support parallel test execution.

When tests run concurrently, shared mutable data can cause:

* Data collisions
* Test interference
* Duplicate records
* Incorrect assertions
* Non-deterministic failures

To reduce these issues, the framework should use:

* Unique generated identifiers
* Test-specific accounts
* Isolated records
* Worker-aware data where necessary
* Independent setup and cleanup

Example:

```text
Worker 1 → customer_001
Worker 2 → customer_002
Worker 3 → customer_003
```

---

## 9.14 Test Data Validation

Test data itself must be validated when necessary.

Before execution, the framework may verify:

* Required accounts exist
* Required products are available
* Required roles exist
* Required configuration is active
* Required test data is valid

Environment validation should prevent false failures caused by missing or invalid test data.

---

## 9.15 Test Data Traceability

Important test data should be traceable to the scenarios that depend on it.

Example:

```text
REQ-CART-001
    ↓
TC-CART-001
    ↓
Customer Data
+
Product Data
+
Cart Data
```

This helps determine which tests may be affected when test data changes.

---

## 9.16 Test Data Maintenance

Test data will be reviewed and maintained as application requirements evolve.

Maintenance activities include:

* Removing obsolete data
* Updating changed product structures
* Updating validation values
* Updating roles and permissions
* Updating API payloads
* Updating test accounts
* Updating boundary values
* Reviewing data collisions and duplication
* Reviewing data dependencies

---

## 9.17 Test Data Quality Rules

The following rules will apply:

1. Test data must be relevant to the scenario being tested.
2. Tests should avoid unnecessary shared mutable data.
3. Test data should be reproducible whenever possible.
4. Sensitive information must not be committed to source control.
5. Dynamic data should be used when uniqueness is required.
6. Test data should support positive, negative, and boundary scenarios.
7. Test-generated data should be isolated from unrelated tests.
8. Test data must support local and CI/CD execution.
9. Obsolete or invalid test data should be removed or updated.
10. Test failures caused by invalid test data must be distinguished from genuine application defects.

---

## 9.18 Test Data Strategy Summary

The framework will use a combination of:

**Static Data + Dynamic Data + API-Based Setup + Controlled Application Data + Environment-Specific Configuration**

The preferred strategy is to create or prepare only the data required by each test, keep tests isolated, minimize dependencies on shared state, and externalize sensitive or environment-specific values.

The objective is to ensure that test data contributes to **reliable, deterministic, repeatable, and scalable test execution**.

### Final Principle

**Test data should support the test, not become a hidden dependency that controls whether the test passes or fails.**


# 10. Environment Strategy

The nopCommerce QA Automation Framework will use a controlled, configurable, and repeatable test environment strategy to ensure that automated tests can be executed consistently across local development and CI/CD environments.

The environment strategy defines how the application, browsers, operating systems, configuration, network conditions, credentials, test data, and execution infrastructure are managed during testing.

The objective is to minimize environment-related failures and ensure that test failures can be distinguished from genuine application defects.

---

## 10.1 Environment Objectives

The environment strategy aims to:

* Provide stable and repeatable conditions for test execution.
* Support local and CI/CD execution.
* Separate environment configuration from test logic.
* Support multiple browser configurations.
* Control environment-specific credentials and test data.
* Reduce environment-related false failures.
* Provide sufficient information for failure investigation.
* Support reproducible test execution.
* Identify environment readiness issues before running large test suites.
* Allow the framework to be extended to additional environments in the future.

---

## 10.2 System Under Test

The primary system under test is the nopCommerce web application.

| Item                         | Configuration                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Application                  | nopCommerce                   |
| Application Type             | E-commerce Web Application    |
| Primary Environment          | Public nopCommerce Demo       |
| Application URL              | https://demo.nopcommerce.com/ |
| Primary Automation Framework | Playwright                    |
| Automation Language          | JavaScript                    |
| Test Runner                  | Playwright Test               |
| Version Control              | Git / GitHub                  |
| CI/CD Platform               | GitHub Actions                |

The public demo environment is used as the initial target because it provides a realistic e-commerce application for automation development and validation.

---

## 10.3 Environment Types

The framework will support multiple execution environments conceptually, even when only one environment is initially available.

### Local Development Environment

Used for:

* Test development
* Debugging
* Framework development
* Failure investigation
* Exploratory automation
* Headed execution
* Trace analysis

### CI Environment

Used for:

* Automated regression execution
* Smoke testing
* Cross-browser execution
* Pull-request validation
* Scheduled test execution
* Test reporting

### Staging / Dedicated Test Environment

A dedicated staging or test environment may be supported in the future if available.

It would provide:

* Controlled application state
* Controlled test data
* Reduced external interference
* More predictable regression execution
* Better CI stability

---

## 10.4 Environment Configuration

Environment-specific values must remain outside the test implementation.

Configuration may include:

```text
BASE_URL
ENVIRONMENT
TEST_USERNAME
TEST_PASSWORD
API_BASE_URL
BROWSER
HEADLESS
TIMEOUT
```

Example:

```text
Local
BASE_URL=https://demo.nopcommerce.com

CI
BASE_URL=https://demo.nopcommerce.com
```

The same test logic should be reusable across environments whenever possible.

---

## 10.5 Configuration Management

Configuration will be managed through environment variables and configuration files.

Sensitive values must not be stored directly in source code.

Examples of sensitive or environment-specific values include:

* User credentials
* API tokens
* Authentication secrets
* Environment URLs
* Service credentials

Local development values may be provided through `.env` files where appropriate.

CI values should be provided through GitHub Actions secrets or other secure configuration mechanisms.

The `.env` file containing sensitive information must not be committed to source control.

---

## 10.6 Operating System Strategy

The primary local development environment will use:

```text
Windows 64-bit
```

The CI environment will use the operating system provided by the configured GitHub Actions runner.

The framework should avoid OS-specific assumptions where possible so that test logic remains portable.

OS-specific behavior should be validated separately when it represents a meaningful compatibility risk.

---

## 10.7 Browser Environment Strategy

The initial browser matrix will include:

* Chromium
* Firefox
* WebKit

### Execution Priority

```text
Chromium
   ↓
Firefox
   ↓
WebKit
```

Chromium will be the primary development and fast-feedback browser.

Firefox and WebKit will be used for broader cross-browser validation, particularly for high-risk workflows.

The browser configuration will be managed through Playwright Projects.

---

## 10.8 Viewport and Device Strategy

The framework will support configurable viewport sizes.

### Desktop

* Standard desktop viewport
* Large desktop viewport

### Mobile / Tablet

Playwright device emulation may be used for selected responsive scenarios.

Potential coverage includes:

* Navigation
* Login
* Registration
* Product discovery
* Product details
* Cart
* Checkout
* Account workflows

Device emulation will be treated as compatibility validation and not as a replacement for testing on real physical devices where real-device behavior is required.

---

## 10.9 Network Environment

The initial project requires Internet access because the application is hosted publicly.

The framework should account for network-related variability.

Potential network-related conditions include:

* Connection instability
* Increased latency
* Temporary connection failures
* Third-party service delays
* DNS failures
* Environment availability issues

Network failures should be distinguished from application defects during test analysis.

Where technically appropriate, Playwright request/response interception may be used to simulate selected network conditions.

---

## 10.10 Authentication Environment

Authenticated scenarios will use dedicated test accounts where available.

Credentials must be:

* Environment-specific
* Securely stored
* Externalized from test code
* Reusable only where sharing does not create test interference

Authentication state may be stored and reused through Playwright authentication mechanisms when appropriate.

Tests should not depend on another test having successfully created or modified authentication state.

---

## 10.11 Test Data Environment

Test data will follow the dedicated Test Data Strategy.

The environment must provide or allow creation of:

* Customer accounts
* Admin accounts where applicable
* Product data
* Cart data
* Checkout data
* Order data
* Negative test data

The public demo environment may contain shared or changing data.

Therefore, tests should minimize dependency on mutable shared records.

Where possible, tests should create their own required data through appropriate application interfaces or controlled setup mechanisms.

---

## 10.12 Environment Isolation

Tests should be isolated from one another whenever technically possible.

The framework should avoid:

* Shared mutable accounts
* Shared cart state
* Shared order state
* Test-order dependencies
* Hard-coded assumptions about data created by another test

Preferred model:

```text
Test A → Own State
Test B → Own State
Test C → Own State
```

This supports:

* Parallel execution
* Repeatability
* Re-runs
* Debugging
* CI stability

---

## 10.13 Environment Readiness

Before executing large test suites, the environment should be validated.

Readiness checks may include:

* Application URL is reachable.
* Required pages can be loaded.
* Browser launches successfully.
* Required environment variables are available.
* Required test accounts are available.
* Required test data is available.
* Application authentication is operational.
* Playwright configuration is valid.

If critical readiness checks fail, dependent tests should not be incorrectly reported as product defects.

---

## 10.14 Environment Health Check

The framework may include a lightweight pre-test health check.

Example:

```text
Environment Health Check
        ↓
Application Reachable?
        ↓
Login / Basic Navigation Available?
        ↓
Required Configuration Available?
        ↓
Environment Ready
```

The purpose is to identify obvious environment failures before executing an expensive regression suite.

---

## 10.15 Environment Limitations

The public nopCommerce demo environment may introduce limitations such as:

* Data changes caused by other users
* Dynamic product or catalog data
* Temporary service interruptions
* Shared environment state
* Third-party integration limitations
* Rate limiting
* Network instability
* Environment resets
* Unexpected changes outside the automation project

These limitations must be considered during failure analysis.

A failure should not automatically be classified as an application defect until environmental causes have been considered.

---

## 10.16 Failure Classification

When an automated test fails, the environment will be considered as one possible failure source.

The investigation flow is:

```text
Test Failure
      ↓
Environment Issue?
      ↓
Test Data Issue?
      ↓
Automation / Framework Issue?
      ↓
Application Defect?
```

Evidence should be collected where appropriate, including:

* Screenshot
* Trace
* Video
* Console logs
* Network information
* Environment
* Browser
* Timestamp
* Test data identifiers

---

## 10.17 Local Execution Strategy

Local execution will primarily support:

* Test development
* Debugging
* Failure reproduction
* Headed execution
* Individual test execution
* Targeted test groups
* Trace inspection

Typical local execution modes:

```text
Headed
   ↓
Debugging / Development

Headless
   ↓
Fast local validation

Targeted Test
   ↓
Feature-specific investigation
```

---

## 10.18 CI Execution Strategy

CI execution will use GitHub Actions.

The CI environment should support:

1. Source checkout
2. Dependency installation
3. Playwright installation
4. Environment configuration
5. Environment readiness checks
6. Test execution
7. Test result collection
8. HTML report generation
9. Failure artifact collection

Artifacts may include:

* Screenshots
* Traces
* Videos where configured
* HTML reports
* Logs

---

## 10.19 Environment Matrix

The initial environment matrix is:

| Area               | Configuration                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Application        | nopCommerce                           |
| Primary Target     | Public Demo                           |
| Local OS           | Windows 64-bit                        |
| CI                 | GitHub Actions                        |
| Primary Browser    | Chromium                              |
| Secondary Browsers | Firefox, WebKit                       |
| UI Automation      | Playwright                            |
| Language           | JavaScript                            |
| Network            | Internet / HTTPS                      |
| Test Data          | Synthetic / controlled where possible |
| Authentication     | Dedicated test credentials            |
| Execution          | Local + CI                            |
| Reporting          | Playwright HTML Report                |

---

## 10.20 Environment Scalability

The framework should be designed so that additional environments can be added without rewriting test logic.

Potential future environments include:

```text
Development
    ↓
Test / QA
    ↓
Staging
    ↓
Production-like
```

Environment-specific differences should remain in configuration rather than in individual test cases.

---

## 10.21 Environment Maintenance

Environment maintenance will include:

* Updating URLs
* Updating credentials
* Updating browser versions
* Updating Playwright versions
* Updating environment variables
* Reviewing test accounts
* Reviewing test data
* Monitoring environment availability
* Updating CI runner configuration
* Documenting known environment limitations

Changes to the environment should be evaluated for their potential impact on automated test stability.

---

## 10.22 Environment Governance

Environment changes should be documented when they can affect test results.

Important changes may include:

* Application version changes
* Major configuration changes
* Authentication changes
* API endpoint changes
* Database resets
* Browser updates
* CI runner changes
* Third-party integration changes

The objective is to maintain confidence that changes in test results are caused by the application or test code rather than undocumented environment changes.

---

## 10.23 Environment Strategy Success Criteria

The environment strategy will be considered effective when:

* Tests can be executed consistently locally.
* CI execution is reproducible.
* Environment-specific configuration is externalized.
* Sensitive credentials are protected.
* Tests are isolated from unnecessary shared state.
* Environment-related failures can be identified.
* Browser configurations can be executed predictably.
* Additional environments can be added without major test-code changes.
* Test failures contain sufficient environment information for investigation.

---

## Final Principle

**A reliable automation framework requires a predictable and well-controlled execution environment. Environment configuration, test data, credentials, browser settings, and execution infrastructure should remain separate from test logic so that the same automation can run consistently across supported environments.**
